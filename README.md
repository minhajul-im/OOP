# OOP (Object Oriented Programming)

This repository is a collection of my learning journey in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

I am focusing on mastering key OOP principles such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction, with practical examples and projects.

Each commit represents a step in applying these concepts, whether through basic examples like creating a Bank Account class or more advanced design patterns.
